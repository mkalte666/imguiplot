# Don't use this 
This one was crafted for special use cases on my end, back when ImPlot just got started as well. The folks over there did it better however, so you are really better off using https://github.com/epezent/implot instead! Its the overall better lib! 
Im gonna do so as well for newer projects, and probably refactor my old stuff as well. 

Anyway, moving on

This is a simple plotting widget for imgui. 

### inspired by 
I have been looking at https://github.com/soulthreads/imgui-plot, imguis PlotLines and some other places i forgot about. 
I ended up with this. 

### example usage
I built this for laa, and there is plently of code there using it and more or less all the features i think. 
As a starting point: 

https://github.com/mkalte666/laa/blob/master/src/irview.cpp 

The results look like this (older version of laa and imguiplot):
